Here, have three regular triangles.

I want you to take three of them, and put them together like this, joined around a point:

[IMAGE: three triangles around a point]

Then fold them together.

[ANIMATION: fold the triangles into a cone]

It is a nice "coincidence" that the hole left at the end of the cone is also triangle-shaped, and we can fit a fourth regular triangle there:

[ANIMATION: fit a fourth triangle in the hole]

Voil√†, our first Platonic solid. It's called the (regular) _tetrahedron_.

Sidebar: A _Platonic solid_ is a polyhedron whose faces are all the same regular polygon.

What happens if instead of three triangles, we fit three squares around a point?

[ANIMATION: fold three squares into a cone]

So far, so good. This time the hole didn't come out as neat... but if we make two copies of the same shape, we might notice that they join perfectly together:

[ANIMATION: fold two copies of three squares into cones, then join them together]

This, of course, is the _cube_. Greek nomenclature would insist on calling it the (regular) _hexahedron_, but we seldom hear that, because the cube is our favorite.

Spurred by our success, we might also try to fold 5-gons together. This time, it turns out to be more successful to start with a 5-gon in the middle, and surround it with other 5-gons in a flower configuration:

[IMAGE: pentagon flower]

Then we fold the flower into a kind of bowl shape.

[ANIMATION: fold the flower into a bowl]

The minor miracle that now happens is that if we have two such bowls, they fit perfectly together, just like the cube halves did:

[ANIMATION: fold two bowls, join them together]

The resulting Platonic solid is called a *dodecahedron*:

Let's pause and take stock. What we just did works for triangles, squares and 5-gons:

[TABLE: joining triangles, squares, and 5-gons into Platonic solids]

A reasonable next thing to try would be regular 6-gons. But it doesn't work!

[IMAGE: 3 6-gons joined together -- can't fold this!]

The reason is that a necessary component of doing the folding we've done is something called a *angle defect*: the gap left between the first and the last polygon around the point:

[IMAGE: the angle defects in the 3, 4, 5 case]

In the case of 6-gons, there is no such gap:

[IMAGE: no angle defect in the 6 case]

With no gap it can't fold up into a cone, and therefore it can't form a Platonic solid. We will follow leave that case now and follow up on it in the chapter about tesselations.

The angle defect comes from the fact that the three inner angles in the polygons don't quite add up to a full turn:

[TABLE: cases 3, 4, 5: inner angle, sum of 3 inner angles, angle defect]

We can see that it's never going to get better with higher side counts. In fact, it gets progressively worse:

[TABLE: cases 6, 7, 8]

However, there's enough angle defect in the triangle case to fit either four or five triangles around a point.

[IMAGE: four triangles around a point, five triangles around a point]

Let's see where that gets us. Fold'em up.

[ANIMATION: fold the four triangles, and the five triangles]

In the case of the four triangles, we're again lucky and the shape fits with a copy of itself:

[ANIMATION: fold two copies of four triangles, join them together]

That gives us the *octahedron*.

In the case of the five triangles, we can add in some extra triangles to create a kind of pretty star-bowl:

[ANIMATION: five triangles, add five more into a star, fold]

This is the shape that just so happens to fit well with a copy of itself:

[ANIMATION: two star shapes, fold them, join them]

All five platonic solids have a *dual*. (XXX excellent explanations of duals here.) The 6-hedron and the 8-hedron are duals. The 12-hedron and the 20-hedron are duals. The 4-hedron is its own dual.
