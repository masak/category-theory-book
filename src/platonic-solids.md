There are only five of them.

The rules for making a platonic solid are as follows:

* You pick a regular polyhedron with `n` sides.
* You pick a whole number `k` of polygons meeting at each vertex.

Then only these combinations of `(n, k)` can exist:

There's a short and sweet proof of this. [PROOF] It's been known for millennia.

The platonic solids generally go by these names.

But in this book we're going to settle on slightly shorter names, breaking with Greek tradition.
