There are only five of them.

The rules for making a platonic solid are as follows:

* You pick a regular polyhedron with `n` sides.
* You pick a whole number `k` of polygons meeting at each vertex.

Then only these combinations of `(n, k)` can exist:

There's a short and sweet proof of this. [PROOF] It's been known for millennia.

The platonic solids generally go by these names.

But in this book we're going to settle on slightly shorter names, breaking with Greek tradition.

All five platonic solids have a *dual*. (XXX excellent explanations of duals here.) The 6-hedron and the 8-hedron are duals. The 12-hedron and the 20-hedron are duals. The 4-hedron is its own dual.
